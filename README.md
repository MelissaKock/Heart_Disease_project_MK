# Heart_Disease_project_MK

Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States.

This analysis was originally conducted to study the relationship between mental health issues and heart disease. 
The original hypothesis stated: People with many days in a month where their mental health is bad, are more susceptible to heart disease 
than people who have few days in a month where their mental health is bad.

I started by planning these project questions. 

Which health factors contribute the most to heart disease? 
What are the differences in heart disease cases between white males and white females? 
Is there a difference in heart disease cases in races besides white? 
What ages are the most susceptible to heart disease?
